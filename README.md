Looking to Install the Pagekit CMS...check out this All-In-One Unattended Installation Script

This script rolls a Digital Ocean droplet from base Ubuntu server to a development-ready Pagekit CMS environment. Pagekit is “A modern Open Source CMS (Content Management System). Intuitive. Modular. Flexible.” similar to the likes of Joomla and WordPress. 

Pagekit is one of the lowest performance-taxing CMS options on the market currently, it is entirely open-source, and it is built from cutting edge core web technologies like Node.js, gulp, bower, MySQL, and PHP. The management interface is beautiful and intuitive, offering critical information in a dashboard-like presentation format. This makes management of the server, content tracking, analytics, and content publishing extremely easy on the user.

Unfortunately, because it is so cutting-edge, developers must compile the tools, dependencies, and frameworks when installing Pagekit. This process can be painful and full of issues and roadblocks. This script aims to mitigate the stress of setting up the environment so that developers can spend more time doing what they want to do, develop. This script initiates an unattended install of Pagekit and its dependencies after querying the user of the site name and the desired MySQL database password.
